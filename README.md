# AI YouTube Video Summarizer

This project is an AI-powered tool that finds a YouTube video on a given topic, transcribes its audio, and generates a custom summary based on your instructions. It's perfect for quickly grasping the key points of educational videos, talks, or lectures.

## Features

- **YouTube Video Search**: Finds the most relevant video for any topic using the YouTube Data API.
- **Audio Transcription**: Downloads the video's audio and uses OpenAI's Whisper for accurate transcription.
- **Customizable Summarization**: Leverages the Google Gemini API to create summaries tailored to specific needs (e.g., a summary for a beginner vs. an expert).
